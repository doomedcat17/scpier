            <td>In a manner similar to Experiment 1097-2, SCP-1097 exhibits physical traits, mannerisms, and knowledge of D-23142. Upon Researcher Upton's disengagement of the security doors leading into the testing chamber, D-23142 feigns sudden illness. When medical personnel respond, SCP-1097 attacks nearby security staff, causing a brief containment breach. Containment re-established with 2 fatalities and 4 personnel injured. D-23142 summarily terminated.</td>

SCP-1097's facial features resemble an amalgamation of D-31057 and D-29003, including such features as D-29003's surgically repaired cleft lip and an 8&nbsp;cm scar over D-31057's right eyebrow. For the duration of the test, SCP-1097 huddles in the corner of the testing chamber, refusing to interact with researchers.</td>

SCP-1097, like D-10772, demonstrates ASL fluency, and is able to communicate with test subjects and researchers. SCP-1097 challenges D-10772 to a game of chess; after three hours of compliance with researchers' inquiries, SCP-1097 is granted its request in exchange for its cooperation, and a chess set and board is introduced into the testing chamber via robotic drone. SCP-1097 defeats D-10772 in eight moves.</td>

SCP-1097 quickly moves to embrace D-95523 with four of its limbs, causing acute chemical burns over most of D-95523's body. After approximately 2 minutes, D-95523 loses consciousness. SCP-1097 decreases in height by 1.2&nbsp;m, and assumes the appearance of a normal human male. SCP-1097 is docile and cooperative for the duration of the experiment. D-95523 dies of his injuries three days later.</td>
