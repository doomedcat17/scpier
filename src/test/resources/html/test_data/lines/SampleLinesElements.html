    <p id="sampleLineWithHeader"><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-012 was retrieved by Archaeologist K.M. Sandoval
        during the excavation of a
        northern Italian tomb destroyed in a recent storm. The object, a piece of handwritten musical score entitled "On
        Mount Golgotha", part of a larger set of sheet music, appears to be incomplete. The red/black ink, first thought
        to be some form of berry or natural dye ink, was later found to be human blood from multiple subjects. The first
        personnel to locate the sheet (Site 19 Special Salvage) had two (2) members descend into insanity, attempting to
        use their own blood to finish the composition, ultimately resulting in massive blood loss and internal trauma.

        <strong>Objects Observed:</strong> Bibles<br>
        <strong>Notes:</strong> Due to the wide variation in sizes of individual copies, estimates of the number of
        Bibles present ranged from 3 billion to 6 billion. The pile was searched for early copies of potential
        historical significance, but given the number of copies present an exhaustive search was not possible. The
        earliest copy located dated to 1607.</p>
