                <li>Trial 1 - SCP-262 is placed on an anatomically-correct human male mannequin dressed in typical SCP
                    personnel attire. After several minutes, a single human arm emanating from the inner lining of
                    SCP-262 reaches up towards the mannequin's face. After several prods of apparent curiosity, the arm
                    retreats and no further movement is recorded for the duration of the test.

                <li>Trial 4 - SCP researchers place SCP-262 over the head and shoulders of a similar, but different
                    mannequin. After a few moments, SCP-262 fell to the ground with the entirety of the test mannequin
