            </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-049</p>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
        <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-049 is contained within a Standard Secure Humanoid
            Containment Cell in Research Sector-02 at Site-19. SCP-049 must be sedated before any attempts to transport
            it. During transport, SCP-049 must be secured within a Class III Humanoid Restriction Harness (including a
            locking collar and extension restraints) and monitored by no fewer than two armed guards.</p>
        <p>While SCP-049 is generally cooperative with most Foundation personnel, outbursts or sudden changes in
            behaviour are to be met with elevated force. Under no circumstances should any personnel come into direct
            contact with SCP-049 during these outbursts. In the event SCP-049 becomes aggressive, the application of
            lavender (<em>L. multifida</em>) has been shown to produce a calming effect on the entity. Once calmed,
            SCP-049 generally becomes compliant, and will return to containment with little resistance.</p>
        <p>In order to facilitate the ongoing containment of SCP-049, the entity is to be provided with the corpse of a
            recently deceased animal (typically a bovine or other large mammal) once every two weeks for study. Corpses
            that become instances of SCP-049-2 are to be removed from SCP-049's containment cell and incinerated.
            SCP-049 is no longer permitted to interact with human subjects, and requests for human subjects are to be
            denied.</p>
        <p><strong>Temporary Containment Procedure Update:</strong> (<em>See Addendum 049.3</em>) Per Containment
            Committee Order 049.S19.17.1, SCP-049 is no longer permitted to interact directly with any members of
            Foundation staff, nor is it to be provided with any additional corpses to be used in its surgeries. This
            order shall persist indefinitely, until such time a consensus regarding the ongoing containment of SCP-049
            can be reached.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-049 is a humanoid entity, roughly 1.9 meters in height, which bears the
            appearance of a medieval plague doctor. While SCP-049 appears to be wearing the thick robes and the ceramic
            mask indicative of that profession, the garments instead seem to have grown out of SCP-049's body over
            time<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-1" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref"
                                            onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>,
            and are now nearly indistinguishable from whatever form is beneath them. X-rays indicate that despite this,
            SCP-049 does have a humanoid skeletal structure beneath its outer layer.</p>
        <p>SCP-049 is capable of speech in a variety of languages, though tends to prefer English or medieval French<sup
                class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-2" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref"
                                       onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>. While
            SCP-049 is generally cordial and cooperative with Foundation staff, it can become especially irritated or at
            times outright aggressive if it feels that it is in the presence of what it calls the "Pestilence". Although
            the exact nature of this Pestilence is currently unknown to Foundation researchers, it does seem to be an
            issue of immense concern to SCP-049.</p>
        <p>SCP-049 will become hostile with individuals it sees as being affected by the Pestilence, often having to be
            restrained should it encounter such. If left unchecked, SCP-049 will generally attempt to kill any such
            individual; SCP-049 is capable of causing all biological functions of an organism to cease through direct
            skin contact. How this occurs is currently unknown, and autopsies of SCP-049's victims have invariably been
            inconclusive. SCP-049 has expressed frustration or remorse after these killings, indicating that they have
            done little to kill "The Pestilence", though will usually seek to then perform a crude surgery on the corpse
            using the implements contained within a black doctor's bag it carries on its person at all times<sup
                    class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-3" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref"
                                           onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>.
            While these surgeries are not always "successful", they often result in the creation of instances of
            SCP-049-2.</p>
        <p>SCP-049-2 instances are reanimated corpses that have been operated on by SCP-049. These instances do not seem
            to retain any of their prior memories or mental functions, having only basic motor skills and response
            mechanisms. While these instances are generally inactive, moving very little and in a generally ambulatory
            fashion, they can become extremely aggressive if provoked, or if directed to by SCP-049. SCP-049-2 instances
            express active biological functions, though these are vastly different from currently understood human
            physiology. Despite these alterations, SCP-049 often remarks that the subjects have been "cured".</p>
        <p><strong>Addendum 049.1:</strong> Discovery</p>
        <p>SCP-049 was discovered during the investigation of a series of unknown disappearances in the town of
            Montauban in southern France. During a raid on a local home, investigators found several instances of
            SCP-049-2, as well as SCP-049. While law enforcement personnel engaged the hostile 049-2 instances, SCP-049
            was noted as watching the engagement and taking notes in its journal. After all of the 049-2 instances were
            dispatched, SCP-049 willingly entered Foundation custody.</p>

            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>In French</em>) So then, how should we begin? An introduction?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> (<em>Aside</em>) Is that French? Can we get a translator-</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>In English</em>) The King's English! No need for translation, sir, I can
                speak it well enough.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> Good. My name is Dr. Raymond Hamm, and I-</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> Ah! A doctor! A like-minded individual, no doubt. Wherein is your speciality,
                sir?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> Cryptobiology, why-</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Laughs</em>) A medical man, such as myself. Wonders abound! And here I
                worried I had been abducted by common street thugs! (<em>Looks around the room</em>) This place, then.
                This is your laboratory? I had wondered, as clean as it is, and with such little trace of the Pestilence
                here.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> The Pestilence? What do you mean?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> The Scourge! The Great Dying. Come now, you know, the, uh… (<em>taps temple
                furiously</em>) …what is it they call it, the… the… ah, no matter. The Pestilence, yes. It abounds
                outside these walls, you know. So many have succumbed, and many more will continue to, until such time
                as a perfect cure can be developed. (<em>Leans back in its chair</em>) Fortunately, I am very close. It
                is my duty in life to rid the world of it, you see. The Cure To End All Cures!</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> When you say "The Great Dying", are you talking about the bubonic plague?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) I don't know what that is.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> I see. Right, well, the entities our agents encountered at that house, they
                were dead when you encountered them, yes? And you reanimated them?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> Hrmm, in a manner of speaking. You see things too simply, doctor! Expand your
                horizons. Life and death, sickness and health, these are amateur terms for amateur physicians. There is
                only one ailment that exists in the world of men, and that is the Pestilence. And nothing else! Make no
                mistake, they were very ill, all of them.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> You think you cured those people?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> Indeed. My cure is <em>most</em> effective.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> The things we recovered were not human.</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Pauses and glares at Dr. Hamm</em>) Yes, well, it is not a
                <em>perfect</em> cure. But that will come with time. And further experimentation! I have spent a
                lifetime developing my methods, Dr. Hamm, and will spend a lifetime more, if necessary. Now, we have
                wasted too much time. There is work to do! I will require a laboratory of my own, one where I can
                continue my research unimpeded. And assistants, of course, though I can provide those on my own, in
                time. (<em>Laughs</em>)</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> I don't think our organization will be willing to-</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> Nonsense. We are all men of science. Fetch your coat and show me to my
                quarters, doctor. (<em>Gestures with pointed stick</em>) Our work begins now!</p>

        <p><em>Interviewer's Note: While SCP-049 is capable of communicating in a very human way, there is a strange
            sense of unease that one experiences when in its presence. Make no mistake, there is something very uncanny
            about this entity indeed.</em></p>
        <p><em>Additionally, we've confiscated that pointed stick that SCP-049 keeps waving around. Part of this was due
            to standard confiscation protocols for the possessions of anomalies, and part because 049 really is a menace
            swinging it around like he does. The entity was displeased at first, but after we made some concessions in
            providing it with "test subjects" (which are, admittedly, more for the benefit of our own research) it
            warmed up to the idea.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Addendum 049.2:</strong> Observation Log</p>
        <p>While in containment at Site-19, SCP-049 has spent a considerable amount of time studying and performing
            surgery on the various mammalian corpses it has been provided. SCP-049 will routinely spend several days
            performing surgery, and then (regardless of whether or not the corpse becomes an instance of SCP-049-2)
            spending several more days documenting its findings in a thick leather journal stored within its doctor's
            bag. SCP-049 will often seek to share its findings with members of Foundation staff.</p>
        <p>The following is a log of several occasions during which SCP-049 was observed operating on a mammalian
            corpse.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Observational Log 049.OL.1 SUMMARY</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-049</p>
            <p><strong>Preface:</strong> A test subject (D-85123) was introduced into SCP-049's containment cell. The
                entity expressed sincere gratitude towards all members of the containment and research staff.</p>
            <p><strong>Observation Notes:</strong> SCP-049 began by asking D-85123 several standard medical questions,
                as it began removing tools from its bag. Shortly after finishing its preparations, SCP-049 quickly
                closed the distance between the two, killing the subject with a touch to its throat. Afterwards, SCP-049
                made a number of considerable alterations to the basic structure of the subject's corpse, often
                introducing fluids from within its bag into the subject by way of a hand powered pump and copper tubing.
            </p>
            <p>The resulting 049-2 instance became animated, flailing and grasping at the walls of the chamber with a
                number of manufactured limbs while moaning out of an oblong orifice now present in its sternum. During
                this time, SCP-049 was observed taking notes of the instance in its journal, and remarking to the
                watching research staff about the efficacy of its cure. Security personnel entered the chamber to move
                SCP-049 back to containment, and were attacked by the instance. The security team dispatched the 049-2
                instance, and SCP-049 returned to containment with no resistance, stating that it was pleased with the
                results.</p>

            <p><strong>Observational Log 049.OL.2 SUMMARY</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-049</p>
            <p><strong>Preface:</strong> SCP-049 was provided the corpse of a recently deceased goat. SCP-049 expressed
                gratitude at the provision.</p>
            <p><strong>Observation Notes:</strong> SCP-049 operated on the goat corpse for several days, eventually
                resulting in an instance of SCP-049-2. SCP-049 expressed pleasure in this outcome, though admitted "the
                disease was still in its nascent stage. My veterinarian practice is rudimentary, but the patient
                responded well to the procedure."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Observational Log 049.OL.3 SUMMARY</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-049</p>
            <p><strong>Preface:</strong> SCP-049 was provided the corpse of a recently deceased orangutan. SCP-049
                expressed noted gratitude at the provision, due to the similarities between the orangutan and common
                human physiology.</p>
            <p><strong>Observation Notes:</strong> SCP-049 spent several days operating on the orangutan, reanimating it
                several times. However, SCP-049 appeared to be discontent with the results it experienced, returning to
                the creature three times after its initial reanimation for additional work. After it was unable to
                reanimate the corpse a fifth time, SCP-049 turned the corpse over to Foundation staff for incineration,
                stating "I have learned so much from this, though I fear my early optimism was misplaced. I hadn’t yet
                come across such a… a stumbling block on my road to the cure. More subjects like this would do a great
                deal in advancing my research."</p>

            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-049</p>
            <p><strong>Preface:</strong> SCP-049 was provided the corpse of a recently deceased bovine. SCP-049
                expressed mild annoyance at the provision, though accepted it nonetheless<sup class="footnoteref"><a
                        id="footnoteref-4" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref"
                        onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>.</p>
            <p><strong>Observation Notes:</strong> SCP-049 spent several days operating on the bovine corpse, breaking
                only to dine on a requested dinner of thin crackers, salted pork, and hard cheese<sup
                        class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-5" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref"

                Beginning first by embalming the corpse, SCP-049 was observed producing a number of long syringes from
                its bag, each containing a different dark, viscous fluid. SCP-049 described these fluids as "essences of
                the humors", and elaborated by saying "the Pestilence may bring about a systemic imbalance. In such a
                case, before true healing can begin, one must find the humors in balance or the body will reject the
                cure."<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-6" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref"
                                                  onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>Over the next few days, SCP-049 spent a considerable amount of time adjusting the organs of the bovine
                corpse with a number of large metal instruments. After eight days, SCP-049 produced a lightning rod,
                which Dr. Hamm exchanged for an electric cattle prod attached to an extension cord, and struck the
                corpse in several locations. This action seemingly had the effect of reanimating the bovine, which once
                again became ambulatory, despite the inversion of the head and reorientation of its limbs.</p>

            <p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> We've watched you work for several weeks now, and honestly I'm not sure I
                understand what you're doing. Can you describe your process in detail?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> Oh goodness no, the process is most intensive. As I said to your assistant, the
                best instruction you will find about my methods are here in my journals, as I have kept exhaustive
                records of my work<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-7" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref"

                there.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> I see. My concern, doctor, is that we still don't understand what you're
                seeking to cure, or how it manifests, or how turning these creatures into quasi-living, mindless drones
                helps in that effort.</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> You do not understand the Pestilence? Even after all this time? Doctor, it is
                an unspeakable horror, one that has shown its true face many times before and will again. I find myself
                blessed with the wisdom and good senses needed to root it out and destroy it, but many like yourself
                cannot. It is a cruel judgement, I fear, to be at the mercy of a disease you cannot fully comprehend!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> That still doesn't answer my question. How is your cure any kind of cure at
                all?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Growing suddenly agitated</em>) It <em>is</em> a cure! You may laugh at my
                efforts if you please, but do not besmirch the good name of scientific progress that has developed this
                great mercy. What you so shortsightedly see here is a life better than any this creature could have
                hoped for, stricken as it was with Pestilence. This creature is now clean, unable to spread the
                Pestilence and free from the terror it would have experienced otherwise.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> This is hardly a creature at all, doctor, it's not even-</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Very agitated</em>) Do not <em>jape</em> with me, sir! You and your
                colleagues are like so many others, unable to look past minor setbacks to see the salvation taking place
                before your very eyes. Do you wait to remove rotten timbers until the hall collapses on top of you? No.
                You find them and you <em>pull them out</em> and replace them with those untouched by rot! And most of
                all, you do not simply <em>mock</em> the structure because it now looks different to you. It is strong!
                It is free of disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to agitate you. I'm just trying to understand.</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Deep breath</em>) Yes, well, do mind your words in the future, doctor. I
                am a professional, but even professionals may feel the bite of pride in dealing with criticism of their
                masterpiece. I will forgive this as an act of good faith between colleagues.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Hamm:</strong> Is there anything else I can help you with?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Pauses, looking away from Dr. Hamm</em>) No, that will be all. Another
                test subject, on the usual schedule. You know my preference of subjects with more human anatomies.</p>
            <p>[END LOG]</p>
            <p><strong>Attending Researcher's Note:</strong> SCP-049 does seem to genuinely want to help other humans,
                though it has not yet been able to provide a concrete example of what exactly it is trying to save us
                all from. I have watched it now over several weeks, and while the outcomes do not seem to ever change,
                SCP-049 continues to claim that it is growing closer to its perfect cure. I think the entity may be more
                aware of the reality of these outcomes than it would like us to think.</p>

        <p><strong>Addendum 049.3:</strong> 04/16/2017 Incident</p>
        <p>Starting shortly after SCP-049's initial containment, Dr. Hamm conducted a number of interviews with the
            subject regarding its anomalous properties, and over time began to note its displeasure with its subjects
            and the SCP-049-2 instances. This continued for a period of several months, during which SCP-049 never
            exhibited any aggressive behaviours.</p>
        <p>On April 16th, 2017, as Dr. Hamm was entering SCP-049's test chamber to conduct another routine interview,
            the entity began to grow anxious and asked Dr. Hamm if he was feeling well. Following protocol, Dr. Hamm
            reminded SCP-049 that the interview was required, after which the entity became hostile and attacked Dr.
            Hamm, killing him. Due to a lapse in security protocol, and because Dr. Hamm did not activate the in-chamber
            emergency system, Dr. Hamm's corpse was not discovered until three hours later, by which point SCP-049 had
            converted it into an instance of SCP-049-2.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of this incident, SCP-049 was interviewed by Dr. Theron Sherman.</p>

            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 5/7/17</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Elijah Itkin</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-049</p>
            <p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Itkin:</strong> SCP-049, we are conducting this interview to close out our investigation of
                your actions taken on April 16th that resulted in the death of a staff member. Do you have any comments
                to make?</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> Only that I look forward to the day when you will allow me to resume my work! I
                have spent the last few weeks compiling my notes and constructing a new theory for how the Pestilence
                was able to infect someone in such an insidious manner that I nearly couldn't detect it.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Itkin:</strong> Have you experienced any remorse for your actions? For the death of Dr. Hamm?
            </p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Waves his hand</em>) Ah, yes. Well, the death of a colleague is always
                regrettable, but in the face of the Pestilence we must be <em>swift</em>, doctor, and act without
                hesitation.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Itkin:</strong> Dr. Sherman noted in his report that you seemed to be mournful during your
                initial interview.</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> Mourn- (<em>Pauses</em>) Perhaps. I had not thought that… It is lamentable that
                a fellow doctor became infected, but the work continues. Regrettable as… as it was, Dr. Hamm's death
                provided important insight. Living human subjects are the only way to proceed forward, I am decided. My
                cure is of little use on dead flesh, and I have gleaned all I can from your generous supply of corpses.
                My desires turn towards tending to those still living who suffer from the disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Itkin:</strong> I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.</p>
            <p><strong>SCP-049:</strong> (<em>Laughs</em>) <a href="/going-home">Oh doctor, I wouldn't be so sure.</a>

                The space within this bag is seemingly anomalously large, as SCP-049 has been observed pulling objects

                SCP-049 had stated its desire to work on human subjects several times between this occasion and the

        <p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-087</p>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
        <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-087 is located on the campus of [REDACTED]. The doorway
            leading to SCP-087 is constructed of reinforced steel with an electro-release lock mechanism. It has been
            disguised to resemble a janitorial closet consistent with the design of the building. The lock mechanism on
            the doorknob will not release unless ██ volts are applied in conjunction with counter-clockwise rotation of
            the key. The inside of the door is lined with 6 centimeters of industrial foam padding.</p>
        <p>Due to the results of the final exploration (see Document 087-IV), no personnel are permitted access to
            SCP-087.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-087 is an unlit platform staircase. Stairs descend on a 38 degree angle for
            13 steps before reaching a semicircular platform of approximately 3 meters in diameter. Descent direction
            rotates 180 degrees at each platform. The design of SCP-087 limits subjects to a visual range of
            approximately 1.5 flights. A light source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-087, as there are no
            lighting fixtures or windows present. Lighting sources brighter than 75 watts have shown to be ineffective,
            as SCP-087 seems to absorb excess light.</p>
        <p>Subjects report and audio recordings confirm the distressed vocalizations from what is presumed to be a child
            between the ages of █ and ██. The source of the distress calls is estimated to be located approximately 200
            meters below the initial platform. However, any attempts to descend the staircase have failed to bring
            subjects closer to the source. The depth of descent calculated from Exploration IV, the longest exploration,
            is shown to be far beyond both the possible structure of both the building and geological surroundings. At
            this time, it is unknown if SCP-087 has an endpoint.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>SCP-087 has undergone four video recorded explorations by Class-D personnel. Each subject conducting an
            exploration has encountered SCP-087-1, which appears as a face with no visible pupils, nostrils, or mouth.
            The nature of SCP-087-1 is entirely unclear, but it has been determined that it is not the source of the
            pleading. Subjects exhibit feelings of intense paranoia and fear when faced with SCP-087-1, but it is
            undetermined whether said feelings are abnormal or simply natural reactions.</p>
        <p><strong>Addendum:</strong><br>
            Over a period of 2 weeks following Exploration IV, several members of the staff and students from the
            [REDACTED] campus reported knocking at a variable rate of 1-2 seconds per knock coming from the interior of
            SCP-087. The door leading to SCP-087 has been fitted with 6 centimeter thick industrial padding. All reports
            of knocking have ceased.</p>

                    <p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-139 designates the disappearance of Lucian Saxe, formerly a
                        Foundation-employed security specialist. Saxe had, until SCP-139's occurrence, acted as a
                        consultant for Site-97 on the matter of esoteric reanimation methodology.</p>
                    <p>SCP-139 is considered anomalous both due to a persistent infohazard encountered following its
                        occurrence [<a href="javascript:" class="bibcite" id="bibcite-1-83187a"
                                       onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-1')">1</a>] and due to the
                        cut-off of information pertaining to SCP-139 after April 4, 1978. Despite Site-97's best
                        efforts, neither Saxe's past-or-present whereabouts nor the location of a cadaver have been
                        uncovered. Extradimensional travel is suspected but not confirmed.</p>
                    <p>No primary suspects which could be responsible for SCP-139 have been identified, owing to the
                        largely inconclusive results of investigative efforts. As such, SCP-139 is currently considered
                        a cold case [<a href="javascript:" class="bibcite" id="bibcite-2-53565a"
                                        onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('bibitem-2')">2</a>] and is
                        expected to continue indefinitely.</p>

                    <p>Saxe clocks in at Site-97 and declines usual chatter with personnel at the front entrance. Ze
                        enters hir office and does not exit for the remainder of the workday.</p>
                    <p>For a period of twelve hours, Saxe queries forty-two SCiPNET entries pertaining to thaumaturgic
                        workings, global ley-line activity, and available research into Way and Knock techniques. This
                        idle activity contradicts hir otherwise exemplary productivity record and raises concern among
                        Site-97 staff; sensor agents are dispatched appropriately.</p>
                    <p>No further abnormalities occur until Saxe has punched out and arrived at hir residence in
                        suburban Albany. By 10:45 PM, ze vacates hir residence, presumably on foot to avoid detection,
                        and exits the city limits.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 6</span></p>
                    <p>A paper trail of bus and train tickets suggests ze traveled approximately two-thousand kilometers
                        to Topeka, Kansas, arriving at 12:15 PM. Of note, interviewed civilians occasionally describe
                        Saxe as "that damn traitor" when recounting this eighteen-hour period. [<a href="javascript:"

                    <p>After Topeka, the paper trail terminates, and reports of Saxe's location during the following
                        month become increasingly irregular. A car ze is believed to have rented is sighted in Salt Lake
                        City, Utah and Lubbock, Texas on March 10 and March 15 respectively — although the windshield
                        and rightmost tail-light shattered between the two cities. Ze is last documented in Tucson,
                        Arizona after residential police implicate hir in a resist-and-flee incident on suspicions of
                        vagrancy. [<a href="javascript:" class="bibcite" id="bibcite-4-77238a"

                    <p>SCP-139 officially concluded on April 27, 1993, when a minor structural failure revealed a small
                        air-pocket within Site-97's concrete foundation. Although this led to a temporary lockdown due
                        to the destruction of Site-97's courtyard, integrity was eventually restored. Models of the
                        air-pocket prior to the structural failure indicate it resembled a prostrate human body fitting
                        Lucian Saxe's height and build.</p>
                    <p>After the initial excavation, the following personal effects were discovered:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The necrotic flesh of a heavily-decayed human cadaver and several human bones, most
                            pulverized by the aforementioned structural failure.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Foundation keycard for a Site-97 security specialist; ID number scratched out, suggesting
                            deep shame.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A forbidden thaumaturgic ritual to preserve its user's spirit after their death.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A map of ley-line positionings in the contiguous United States, often referenced by enemies
                            of the Foundation. A circle had been drawn around a nexus on the US-Mexico border near
                            Tucson, AZ.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Saxe's cause of death is believed to be terminal dehydration, following several days of
                        entombment.</p>
                    <p>During the investigation of this air-pocket, Site-97 excavators punctured a secondary cut-out
                        hidden within the concrete. Due to the considerable strain that excavation would put on
                        Site-97's foundation, this cut-out has not been analyzed extensively. What can be determined,
                        however, is that it contains a large number of partially-decomposed human eyes, believed to
                        exceed one thousand in total.</p>
                    <p>Perforations within the concrete would have allowed these eyes to observe their target on all
                        sides until ze expired.</p>

        <p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-474</p>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
        <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Portions of SCP-474 which exist inside of physical space are
            secured within Foundation-made pill bottles. Bottles are stored inside a locked medicine cabinet, itself
            located within an anomaly storage vault. All non-hazardous recordings of SCP-474 audio are on the research
            team's shared hard drive space, with any cognitohazardous audio being stored on a secure server with
            restricted access.</p>
        <p>Foundation personnel embedded in educational systems are to encourage zero-tolerance drug policies on college
            campuses in order to maximize the possibility of SCP-474 instances being discovered. Agents under the cover
            of being law enforcement agencies are to seize these whenever possible, and destroy them if deemed
            unrecoverable.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-474 denominates pills produced for non-medicinal purposes by Alexylva
            University in apparent collaboration with the Oneiroi Collective. Each occurrence of SCP-474 is blue, and
            analysis has shown it to be chemically identical to generic sugar-based placebo pills.</p>
        <p>When ingested, SCP-474 will affect the consumer until the next time they enter REM sleep. Audio broadcast
            from Alexylva University will begin playing through their mouths, consisting of station breaks and notes
            associated with that campus' radio station. This spoken-word programming will be in the subject's native
            language, with mute subjects mouthing words and DHH individuals enunciating as they would attempting speech
            normally.</p>
        <p>Although music is frequently referenced, it has not been broadcast audibly. Affected individuals who remember
            their dreams will report them as having a heavy musical theme. Dreamers, even musicians, have been unable to
            replicate the sounds they heard but have universally described it as some variation of 'trippy'.</p>
        <p>The speaker within Alexylva appears to have some connection with the individuals they broadcast through, as
            multiple subjects tuned in to the station in their dreams will have identical muscle contractions and eye
            movement while being affected. <em>See Addendum 474-B for more information.</em></p>
        <p>SCP-474 was discovered after a local broadcast news station in [REDACTED] aired a story about a 'drug craze'
            at a local community college campus. Sixty-five(65) instances of SCP-474 were recovered from various members
            of the student body. Since then, approximately fifty(50) caches of SCP-474 are recovered annually from
            various college and university campuses in North Africa, North America, Europe, Eurasia, Oceania and
            Australia.</p>
        <p>Foundation personnel working on SCP-474 who receive recruitment literature from Alexylva University in their
            dreams are to report to their supervisors immediately upon waking.</p>

        <p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-506</p>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
        <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-506 grows in a 3&nbsp;m x 3&nbsp;m patch of soil, kept watered and fertilized via an automatic system. The air of the room where SCP-506 is kept must be filtered to prevent release of SCP-506 seeds into the environment. Personnel entering the enclosure must wear biohazard suits composed of inorganic material, and must be decontaminated upon leaving the area.</p>
        <p>Due to the potential dangers associated with cross-contamination, SCP-506 and <a href="/scp-124">SCP-124</a> are not to be stored at the same Foundation site under any circumstances.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-506 is a genetically engineered variant of zucchini (<em>Cucurbita pepo</em>) created by the ████████ Corporation as a hardy and rapid-growing food plant. SCP-506 exhibits several undesirable and dangerous qualities:</p>
        <p>(1) SCP-506 will attempt to grow on any organic material, including on living beings. The seeds germinate on contact.</p>
        <p>(2) SCP-506 grows extremely rapidly, reaching full size in five minutes or less.</p>
        <p>(3) Due to its rapid growth, SCP-506 drains its growing medium of nutrients at an accelerated rate. Nothing will grow in soil that has harbored SCP-506 plants without extensive nutrient replacement.</p>
        <p>(4) SCP-506 seeds are much smaller than typical squash seeds, and disperse easily in the wind.</p>
        <p>SCP-506 is inedible, as the seeds will [DATA EXPUNGED] if any are consumed. To the best of the knowledge of The Foundation, SCP-506 has not escaped into the wild, and ████████ Corporation has destroyed all samples in their possession.</p>
        <p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NcrCvq6C6AI" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
        <p>(<em>Note: Labeled as a time lapse in case of accidental public release.</em>)</p>
        <p><strong>Addendum:</strong> SCP-506 is evolving rapidly, as indicated by the incidents below.</p>
        <p><strong>[Incident Report 506-1&nbsp;5/16/20██]</strong><br>
            SCP-506 plants observed attempting to grow on the walls of the containment facility. Although the plants died of malnutrition, testing indicates the latest generation requires 35% fewer nutrients than when originally contained. Research in progress to find materials that do not support SCP-506 growth.</p>
        <p><strong>[Incident Report 506-2&nbsp;9/1/20██]</strong><br>
            Dr. K██████ found dead in the SCP-506 enclosure, covered with plant growth. The means by which his suit was compromised is unknown. SCP-506 roots have been found to secrete a powerful anesthetic, explaining why Dr. K██████ did not sound the alarm or attempt to escape the area.</p>
        <p>Researchers must be under video surveillance while working with SCP-506, with another researcher ready to assist in case of accidental infestation. Reclassification as Euclid recommended.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Electronic</p>
        <p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Two copies of SCP-720 are held in separate storage devices. One is permitted to be used in authorized testing, the other serves as a backup copy. Once per year, an inspection is to be performed to ensure that the storage mediums have not decayed and are still readable. It is not permitted to run SCP-720 without written authorization.</p>
        <p>Agents embedded with the California Highway Patrol are to monitor the Thomas Kikady cold case and seize any evidence recovered by that or any other authority.</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-720 is an anomalous ICRDTA<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-1" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> program playable on any computing system with read-only memory capabilities.</p>
        <p>SCP-720 contains a video game consistent with those produced on the Video Computer System. Players control a single character, designated SCP-720-1, traversing through 9 levels corresponding to a childish rendition of Dante Alighieri's circles of Hell, culminating in a final battle against a representation of Lucifer. SCP-720-1 is able to be equipped with a variety of different items which can be equipped to SCP-720's head or legs<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-2" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>which are required to complete portions of the game.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, SCP-720-1<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-3" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> attempts to communicate with the player or otherwise engages in behavior suggesting sapience. These are always one-sided as SCP-720 is not compatible with audio signal inputs. SCP-720-1's vocalizations are "stream-of-consciousness" in nature and are theorized to reflect SCP-720-1's internal monologue.</p>
        <p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Following the seizure of GoI-078<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-4" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> related machines from Halden's Arcade<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-5" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> in South San Francisco, SCP-720 was found to be on a SD card jammed in the coin slot of SWEAT, a standup cross country arcade simulator. Upon SCP-720 being brought near a transport vehicle's disc drive, its anomalous properties were discovered, and it was brought in for testing with an onsite laptop.</p>

            <p>SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO - The star witness of next month's child abduction trial, 23 year old programmer Thomas Kikady, has disappeared the day after abruptly resigning his programming job. Prosecutors were unable to reach him, and a wellness check on his apartment did not turn up any evidence as to where he may have gone.<br>

"Honestly, more than that, I'm ashamed of the police for allowing this to have happened." Police Chief Stottlemeyer stated Kikady's apartment had been under police protection after anonymous threats were made against the star witness' life. A spokesperson said that foul play has not yet been ruled out.</div>

            <p>Startup continues normally. However, the message of "FLAPPER - May Arcadia Burn In Hell" is absent, instead replaced with "TIBIAL JUNCTION LEVELS LOW." SCP-720-1 responds to this change with a small text box, stating "Oh dear." The game starts up in REDWOOD as the first world, compared to the original, a beach-like level designed to function as a platforming tutorial. SCP-720-1 is equipped with the CROWN OF THORNS from the start, despite not being able to acquire this beanie until the fourth level - ZERTWA. Gameplay continues as normal, though no enemies are present and SCP-720-1's speed is significantly reduced.</p>

            </div>
            <p>SCP-720-1 successfully locates three keys necessary to progress to the next world, <em>ZARATHUSTRA.</em> This world is unchanged, and SCP-720-1 progresses and completes the level normally. Upon completion, however, SCP-720-1 is met with a small text box, shown to the right. Personnel responded with "completing the game," upon which the text box closed, and the world map was shown. Rather than progressing to the third stage, <em>BUCCANEER,</em> SCP-720-1 was put into a tube, and slid down towards <em>BURIAL GROUND.</em> SCP-720-1 was found to have two additional beanies and legs in its inventory, none of which were present in previous playthroughs.</p>

            <p>Upon defeating a <em>King Rancor</em><sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-8" href="javascript:" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>, SCP-720-1 returned to the normal world map. Prior to being allowed to move to the next level, <em>HOMETOWN,</em> SCP-720-1 and personnel were asked the same question. Personnel responded with "To Destroy <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span>." SCP-720-1 responded by producing sounds similar to hushed crying, at which point the game spontaneously crashed. Any future mentions of GoI-78 produced extra health for SCP-720-1 along with an automated voice saying "THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS," and was used as the primary way to regenerate. However, repeated mentions appeared to cause SCP-720-1 emotional distress.</p>

            <p>When SCP-720 was restarted, personnel found SCP-720-1 to no longer be the playable character. Instead, personnel played as "Timothy Werner," a small boy with a balloon. The only level present in the game was <em>THE SCENE,</em> which took place inside an environment that appeared to be inside an arcade. Timothy had little combat ability - instead, gameplay primarily focused on using his balloon to fly over and escape skeletal entities. All enemies appeared to be skeletal or spectral in nature - however, there were approximately 40 total, in 3 different groups, compared to other worlds having nearly 100 spread out amongst the level. This is theorized to be due to the level's small size.</p>
            <div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:128px;"><a href="http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-720/timmy"><img src="http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-720/timmy/medium.jpg" style="width:128px;" alt="timmy" class="image"></a>

                    <p>Timothy.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The end of the level has no boss fight or puzzle - instead, a rudimentary cutscene is triggered as Timothy removes a quarter from his pocket to place it in a machine, which appears similar to <em>Dance Dance Revolution's</em> cabinet. Timothy begins to run on the machine's pads, before laughter can be heard. The screen goes black. When the scene returns, a lump is present on the floor, presumably a dead Timothy, as it appeared similar to his death scenes when touched by an enemy in the level. A spectral form of Timothy can be seen being pulled into the machine - this form lacks legs.</p>
            <p>After this, personnel were able to control SCP-720-1 again, in the level <em>HOMETOWN.</em> Before SCP-720-1 could move, another text box appeared, asking the same question. Personnel were physically unable to type a reply. After 30 seconds of waiting, "GO FASTER" appeared in the response box. The text box closed, and a small flame could be seen above SCP-720-1. This flame was theorized to correspond to a new meter present at the top of the screen - the ABSOLUTION, which decreased in value each time a new pair of legs or beanie was equipped. This meter did not replenish in between worlds. SCP-720-1 progressed through the level, eventually defeating a GR-33D final boss by equipping a new pair of legs, decreasing the ABSOLUTION meter, causing the boss to dissipate. SCP-720-1 continued towards the next level, <em>JUXTAPOSITION.</em></p>

            </div>
            <p>In this level, SCP-720-1 entered the <em>ROLLER RINK</em> present in the background of the previous world. This level was neither present in previous playthroughs, nor did it contain any enemies or hazards. Instead, SCP-720-1 was presented with a choice at the end of the level: a doorway which, when entered, would continue on to the next level, or the ability to "sniff" a small white pile next to a large hole out of which laughter could be heard. The repercussions of this choice are unknown - personnel selected the doorway, before saving.</p>

            <p>The next world, <em>GRAVEYARD,</em> was similar to the previous level in that it contained no enemies. However, this level was present in the original game. SCP-720-1 was directed by personnel to continue forwards into the level's entrance, appearing similar to a graveyard or crypt. SCP-720-1 refused, upon which a small cutscene played, with SCP-720-1 turning towards the screen. It is attached below.</p>
            <p><iframe src="/scp-720/html/e33d7d82abfc8fa3ad4fcfd307c0deb32bad66d1-3515188031212119672" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" class="html-block-iframe" style="height: 360px;"></iframe></p>
            <p>Upon the cutscene finishing, SCP-720-1 was successfully directed to continue. The level was presented as a series of small vignettes, with SCP-720-1 looking at multiple tombstones and reading epitaphs written upon them. The only legible one had "RIPPED FROM US BY THE ANGEL'S DUST" written upon it. SCP-720-1 continuing through the graveyard towards its exit resulted in the triggering of another cutscene. During this cutscene, SCP-720-1 can be seen in an office cubicle, before the viewpoint quickly switches to a first person view, presumably from SCP-720-1's perspective.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>SCP-720-1 types away at their computer until a heavily disfigured man taps SCP-720-1 on the shoulder. This man's username is "N.B." as displayed in white text over their head. "N.B." has no facial structure, its features replaced with a crude rendition of the <span style="color: purple">Arcadia</span> "A" logo, flipped upside down. SCP-720-1's point of view shakes, as "N.B." requests SCP-720-1 to follow him. SCP-720-1 does so, and the environment shifts to a large packaging center, in the middle of which is a large circle. This circle is drawn with red liquid, and a distinct smell of sulfur and bleach is emitted from the laptop's audio ports. A large amorphous being, entirely colored of red pixels, descends from above, as SCP-720-1 can be heard screaming. Hooded figures surround SCP-720-1, who looks down at his hands. They are human hands, and SCP-720-1 has no legs. The large red figure grows large bone-like structures from its rib cage, which develop into hands, legs, and crosses. It makes no sound as it continues towards SCP-720-1, lifting it up with these structures and throwing SCP-720-1 out of a nearby window. SCP-720-1 is shown in a home environment, sitting at a desk, shaking, as a child appearing similar to Timothy Werner is cowering in the far right corner.</p>
            <p>As SCP-720-1 shakes, "N.B." reappears in a doorway, consuming the child. A final boss health bar appears over its head, declaring it "Lucifer," suggesting "N.B." is the new final boss. A large amorphous red entity erupts out of the back of "N.B." as it continues forward, and the two "communicate." This communication appears unscripted, as "filler words" are present in SCP-720-1's responses.</p>

            <p>The temperature of the laptop running SCP-720 began to increase to nearly 204° C, causing severe overheating in nearby personnel. The following audio file played on repeat for approximately 5 minutes, despite the disc drive having stopped spinning due to repeated use. Testing was aborted, and SCP-720 was removed from the laptop's disc drive.</p>

        <p>Following new safety measures, including remote operation of SCP-720 and temperature failsafes, SCP-720 was re-approved for secure testing approximately 4 months later. SCP-720 could not be played upon starting SCP-720. Repeatedly attempting to start up SCP-720 resulted in the spontaneous manifestation of basalt, granite, and sulfur in a 2 meter radius around the laptop running SCP-720, as well as a brief spike in Tartarean Resonant Energy in Site-28's area. The status of SCP-720-1 is currently being determined.<br>
